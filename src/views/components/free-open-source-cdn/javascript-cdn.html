					As a developer, you are probably aware of <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">Google Hosted Libraries</a>. Google offers an easy and
					fast way to include 14 popular JavaScript libraries in your websites.
				</p>

				<p>
					But what if you are a webmaster and you want take advantage of a fast CDN with other less popular projects too? Or if you are
					a developer and you want to make your project easier to access and use by other users?
				</p>

				<p>
					This is where <a href="/">jsDelivr</a> comes into play. jsDelivr is a free and open source CDN created to help developers and webmasters.

				<h3>Adding a library</h3>

				<ol class="ol">
					<li>
						<strong>To add a new library or update an existing one, all the developer has to do</strong> is to use GitHub's web interface to add 2 files to our repository with
						the modifications they see fit. Once a moderator reviews the pull request and merges it, the files become instantly available from
						the official website.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>If a moderator is online, the approval should not take</strong> more than 20 minutes. However, it can take up to 10 hours until someone
						comes online. For existing projects, updates are auto-merged by our bot if they pass all the tests.
					</li>
